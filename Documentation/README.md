# Jacquard Documentation

This document is work-in-progress, and will be for some time.

### Writing in Yarn

Jacquard uses the [Yarn](https://github.com/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner/blob/development/Documentation/YarnSpinner-Dialogue/Yarn-Syntax.md) language. It's quite similar to Twine, but is designed to be integrated straight into a game engine. 

Content in Yarn is split into nodes, which contain text content (dialogue, etc), logic, and functions. For more information, including comprehensive tutorials, see the [YarnSpinner documentation](https://github.com/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner/tree/development/Documentation/YarnSpinner-Dialogue).

#### Using Jacquard

Here's some screenshots, because I love you.

### Feeding Yarn To Your Game Engine Like Very Dry Spaghetti

For now, use [YarnSpinner](https://github.com/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner).
